## Basic Details
### Team Name: VoidWare


### Team Members

### Project Description
People often wonder about the calories in food‚Ä¶ but what about the things we should NEVER eat?
WhyChewThis calculates the ‚Äúcalories‚Äù of absurd items‚Äîlike bricks, socks, USB drives‚Äîin the most ridiculous way possible, so you never accidentally snack on a keyboard again.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
‚ÄúWhat if I accidentally eat my homework? How many calories are in that?‚Äù
Nobody asked for this, but somewhere in the universe, a confused goat probably wants to know.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built scientific(okay, slightly random) calorie calculator for inedible objects.
Just input the object name, and boom‚Äîyou get an utterly meaningless calorie count, plus a sarcastic diet plan.
